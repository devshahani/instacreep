Useless tool of the day. I made something that lets you view the main Instagram feed as someone youâ€™re following (a feed generated based on people they follow). 
You'll either learn something valuable about privacy and social media (the extent to which others can monitor your activity), or, that Elon Musk's feed has a lot of ass.
